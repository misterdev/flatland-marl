### TEST
1. 22:30 - 1k episodes

### Fixed speed 1
- [ ] evaluate 1k episodes
- [ ] train 1k episodes 

### Backlog
- [ ] Permutation of binaries in bitmap relative to the current train
- [ ] return observation from env.step
- [ ] Handle malfunctions

### TODO
- [ ] Calculate altpaths once
- [x] giulia's error. NOTE: it has to do with prediction depth
- [x] FIX
